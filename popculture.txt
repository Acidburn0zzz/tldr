Summary
-------

  - Programming is a science, but also much more than just a science.  It's the 
    people that matter.  The side effects are trends and fashion.

  - It is unreasonable to reject the human and the social aspect of the 
    programming culture.

  - The pop culture in programming makes it more unpredictable.  The 
    unexpetedness can lead to 'Aha!' moments.


Quotes
------

  “ [Alan Kay's] suggestion is that programming is a Pop Culture, because it 
    spreads much, much faster than education and formal study spreads. 

  “ This is one of the reasons why many experienced programmers spend some time 
    on “social” programming sites like Hacker news, Reddit, or Stack Overflow. 
    In a pop culture, keeping up with the trends is necessary to do your job. 
    You can’t design clothes if you spend all your time in a laboratory 
    analyzing fabrics and talking manufacturing techniques, you have to get out 
    in the streets and clubs and cafés and soak up the culture.

  “ Much as a record producer will encourage the musicians to avoid complex 
    chord progressions as being “Inaccessible to the masses.” If you want to 
    get your message out, you must work in gentle, gradual steps that nudge the 
    listener small steps at a time. You must build your bowers and flash your 
    plumage. You must dance and sing. You must write blog posts and speak at 
    conferences.
