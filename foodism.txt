Summary
-------

  - The author used to believe that food would help Americans develop tastes 
    and would lead to the interest in art; instead, food itself has become art.

  - Foodism is culture: requires money, knowledge, connoisseurship. 
    It's a vehicle of social status. Think Veblen's conspicuous 
    consumption.

  - Awards, maestros, literature, performances. "Food now expresses the 
    symbolic values and absorbs the spiritual energies of the educated 
    class."

  - Food & art both begin by addressing the senses, but that is where 
    food stops. "It is not narrative or representational, does not 
    organize and express emotion."

  - "[Food] isn’t going to give you insight into other people, allow 
    you to see the world in a new way, or force you to take an 
    inventory of your soul."


Commentary
----------

A lot of good points in this article, but the ending came across as 
a bit contrived. I think the emergence of this new culture proves two 
points that the article did not mention:

  1. Human beings look for experiences and not necessarily insights 
     into the sense of being. Foodism is a form of subjecting yourself 
     to a distilled experience.

  2. When given enough time, people will create an area of expertise 
     around anything. Any activity converges towards having its 
     connoisseurs. The Web might have made the process faster by 
     enabling people to freely share, exchange and learn.
