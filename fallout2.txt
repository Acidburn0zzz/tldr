Quotes

  “ Even early on, it was obvious that Fallout 2 was full of 
    choices–and this seemed remarkable when I felt like I barely had 
    any in real life.  In the real world I didn’t have a say in what 
    I wore, what I did, or in the messianic responsibility my family 
    forced on me. With men in particular, you don’t ask questions and 
    you do as you are told, remembering to only speak when spoken to.  
    Men work hard for the family, the argument went, and it’s the 
    woman’s job to acquiesce to a man’s every whim. And if they cheat, 
    hey, they’re men.  It’s their need.

  “ It was playing through a version of history where Americans drove 
    themselves to destruction because we refused to stop relying on oil 
    that made me wonder about this country. It was playing through 
    a reality where we valued being a formidable war force above all 
    else that made me worry about this country. It was playing through 
    something where the government cared so little about its citizens 
    that it would knowingly construct vaults with the purpose of 
    experimentation that made me feel sick thinking about what this 
    country was capable of.

  “ The clincher came when I learned that the civil war my family ran 
    away from was actually funded by the United States government–that 
    their safe haven was actually responsible for their great 
    misfortune.
