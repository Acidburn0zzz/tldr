Quotes
------

  “ With popular or eccentric Instagram accounts, you get a peek into 
    another world that isn’t quite possible with other services. If you 
    want to only follow a circus security guard or a famous musician, 
    you can do that through the intimacy of cell phone photos.

  “ It might seem trivial, but showing one photo at a time is a design 
    decision that creates more value for each image, and enhances your 
    viewing experience.

  “ There’s something enticing about knowing that most Instagram photos 
    are created on the iPhone, since it introduces a NASCAR-like 
    equality.  That makes it fun to see what other people can create 
    with the same technical constraints you have. Photography has 
    always been all about the equipment, and not at all about the 
    equipment. Knowing millions of people are creating with roughly the 
    same camera and app as you makes it exciting creatively. So 
    constraints, combined with quality and an audience are what makes 
    Instagram so addictive.
