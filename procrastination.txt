Quotes
------

  “ When you are planning ahead, your better angels point to the 
    nourishing choices, but in the moment you go for what tastes good.  
    […] this is why grocery stores put candy right next to the 
    checkout.

  “ The problem isn’t you are a bad manager of your time – you are 
    a bad tactician in the war inside your brain.

  “ You are really bad at predicting your future mental states. In 
    addition, you are terrible at choosing between now or later. Later 
    is murky place where anything could go wrong.

  “ Evolutionarily it makes sense to always go for the sure bet now; 
    your ancestors didn’t have to think about retirement or heart 
    disease.  Your brain evolved in a world where you probably wouldn’t 
    live to meet your grandchildren. The stupid monkey part of your 
    brain wants to gobble up candy bars and go deeply into debt.

  “ Although almost everyone has problems with procrastination, those 
    who recognize and admit their weakness are in a better position to 
    utilize available tools for precommitment and by doing so, help 
    themselves overcome it.

  “ You must be adept at thinking about thinking to defeat yourself at 
    procrastination.

  “ The trick is to accept the now-you will not be the person facing 
    those choices, it will be the future-you – a person who can’t be 
    trusted.  Future-you will give in, and then you’ll go back to being 
    now-you and feel weak and ashamed. Now-you must trick future-you 
    into doing what is right for both parties.

  “ Your effort is better spent outsmarting yourself than making empty 
    promises through plugging dates into a calendar or setting 
    deadlines for push ups.
