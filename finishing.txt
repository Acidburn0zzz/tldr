Quotes
------

  “ The fact is, if we all had unlimited resources and unlimited time, 
    we’d all make the same crappy, meandering everything game and 
    there’d be no reason to play at all. It’s our limited resources and 
    time that forces us to make tight games that feel like they have 
    a purpose.

  “ You never, ever run out of things to implement… at some point, you 
    have to make the judgement call that the time lost by working 
    longer is more important than the additional things you could bring 
    to the game.  I think we called it pretty good with Doom.

    — John Carmack¹
