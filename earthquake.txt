Quotes
------

  “ When the mall I was in started shaking, I at first thought it was 
    because it was a windy day (Japanese buildings are designed to 
    shake because the alternative is to be designed to fail 
    catastrophically in the event of an earthquake), until I looked out 
    the window and saw the train station.

  “ Let’s talk about trains for a second. One of them were washed away 
    by the tsunami.  All of the rest — including ones travelling in 
    excess of 150 miles per hour — made immediate emergency stops and 
    no one died.  There were no derailments.  There were no collisions.  
    There was no loss of control.  The story of Japanese railways 
    during the earthquake and tsunami is the story of an unceasing 
    drumbeat of everything going right.

  “ The overwhelming response of Japanese engineering to the challenge 
    posed by an earthquake larger than any in the last century was to 
    function exactly as designed.  Millions of people are alive right 
    now because the system worked and the system worked and the system 
    worked.

  “ That this happened was, I say with no hint of exaggeration, one of 
    the triumphs of human civilization.  Every engineer in this country 
    should be walking a little taller this week.
