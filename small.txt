Quotes
------

  “ Sometimes you have to be really high, 
    to see how small you really are.

    — Felix Baumgartner 

  “ It turns out that this feeling is a well documented phenomena 
    dubbed the Overview effect. When a person gazes upon Earth from 
    outer space, they have a profound sense of perspective, 
    a realization of fragility, that humanity and all life as we know 
    it is completely dependent on a single planet and its thin 
    atmosphere.

  “ It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the 
    Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out 
    the planet Earth. I didn’t feel like a giant. I felt very, very 
    small.
    
    — Neil Armstrong
