Quotes
------

  “ It’s no conspiracy. Facebook acknowledged it as recently as last 
    week: messages now reach, on average, just 15 percent of an 
    account’s fans.  In a wonderful coincidence, Facebook has rolled 
    out a solution for this problem: Pay them for better access.

  “ Why are there so many fake Twitter accounts—accounts that can be 
    bought in increments of 1,000 for less than $20? Because during 
    their hot growth phases, social networks had to post continuous 
    user growth.  They had to show how many accounts were being 
    created. And with billions of dollars at stake, they weren’t 
    exactly motivated to eliminate fakes.

  “ It reminds me of that episode of The Sarah Silverman Program where 
    she discovers that the same manufacturer makes her potato chips, 
    toilet paper and diarrhea medicine. Her conspiracy was more 
    visceral, but it’s the same con that social media has discovered: 
    cause a problem, then market the solution.
