Quotes
------

  “ A hurricane gets its energy from warm ocean water, and in the process of 
    water vapor condensing into rain droplets. The heat released during 
    condensation serves to continue to warm the surrounding air, which causes 
    more seawater to evaporate, condense, and continue the cycle.
    
    A fully developed hurricane releases 50 or more terawatts of heat energy at 
    any given moment, only about 1 percent of which is converted into wind. The 
    heat release, Landsea wrote, "is equivalent to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb 
    exploding every 20 minutes."  The entire human race in 2011 used about 
    a third of the energy present in an average hurricane.
    
    So bombing a hurricane might be about as effective as trying to stop 
    a speeding Buick with a feather.
