Summary
-------

  - Advanced machine learning is coming to many MS products next year.

  - It's about time, the competition have not been waiting.

  - MS's advantage is access to tons of data, thanks to multiple points 
    of presence, and vast resources.

  - Azure + data from the XBox & Bing = MS can take on Google and AWS.

  - MS may eventually sell services created by software, in addition to 
    the software itself.


Quotes
------

  “ If its new products work as advertised, Microsoft will find itself 
    in a position it has not occupied for the last few years: relevant 
    to where technology is going.

  “ Like other giants, Microsoft also has something that start-ups like 
    Kaggle do not: immense amounts of money — $67 billion in cash and 
    short-term investments at the end of the last quarter — and the 
    ability to work for 10 years, or even 20, on a big project.

  “ M.S.R. [Microsoft Research] employs 850 Ph.D.’s in 13 labs around 
    the world. They work in more than 55 areas of computing, including 
    algorithm theory, cryptography and computational biology.

  “ Mr. Horvitz started making prototypes of the Outlook assistant 
    about 15 years ago. He keeps digital records of every e-mail, 
    appointment and phone call so the software can learn when his 
    meetings might run long, or which message he should answer first.  
    “Major shifts depend on incremental changes,” he said.
