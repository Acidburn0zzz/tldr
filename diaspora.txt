Quotes
------

  “ Apart from brief periods of openness created by new inventions or 
    antitrust breakups, every medium, starting with the telegraph, has 
    eventually proved to be a case study in monopoly.

  “ Even as each new discovery empowers us, we also risk a kind of 
    slavish attachment, inertia and dependence.

  “ It’s hard to make fear cool. It’s harder yet to make security 
    convenient.
